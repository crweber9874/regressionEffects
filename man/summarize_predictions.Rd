\title{Summarize Predicted Probabilities}
\usage{
summarize_predictions(
  predictions_long,
  prob_col = NULL,
  group_vars = NULL,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  quantiles = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions_long}{A data frame in long format containing:
- One or more grouping variables (e.g., scenario characteristics)
- A column with predicted probabilities from different draws}

\item{prob_col}{Character. Name of the column containing predicted probabilities.
Default is "predicted_prob" for logistic regression or "probability" for ordinal.}

\item{group_vars}{Character vector of variable names to group by when calculating
summary statistics. If NULL (default), will group by all columns except the
probability column and any column named "draw".}

\item{conf_level}{Numeric. Confidence level for intervals. Default is 0.95.}

\item{quantiles}{Numeric vector. Additional quantiles to calculate beyond the
confidence interval. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
A data frame with summary statistics including:
  \item{mean_prob}{Mean predicted probability across draws}
  \item{median_prob}{Median predicted probability across draws}
  \item{sd_prob}{Standard deviation of predicted probability across draws}
  \item{lower_ci}{Lower confidence interval bound}
  \item{upper_ci}{Upper confidence interval bound}
  Additional columns from group_vars will be included.
}
\description{
Takes long-format prediction data with draws and creates summary statistics
including mean predictions and confidence intervals.
