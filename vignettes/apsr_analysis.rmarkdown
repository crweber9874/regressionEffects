## Analysis

Throughout the analysis, we leverage a causal inference framework to estimate the effect of being in the pre-election or post-election period. In the *2020 Western States* data, assignment to the pre- or post- election period is not randomized. Instead, we were fortuitously collecting data over an extended period during the 2020 presidential election, an election in which the results were unknown on election day. In the *2024 Western States* data, assignment to the pre- or post- election period is randomized; respondents were randomly assigned to be interviewed before or after the election results were known. In both datasets, we aim to estimate the treatment effect of being in the pre-election versus post-election period on support for electoral contestation behaviors. According to the *winner-loser* hypothesis, the treatment effect should vary depending on whether the respondent voted for a winning or losing candidate. 

We use *g-computation* to estimate the conditional marginal effects of being in the pre-election versus post-election period, where the marginal effect should vary by vote choice (Trump versus Biden in 2020; Trump versus Harris in 2024). First, we fit an *outcome* regression model, an electoral contestation item (e.g., support for attending a march) as a function of *pre* versus *post* election, *vote choice*, the *interaction between vote choice and pre/post election*, *age*, *Latino*, whether the respondent has a four-year *college degree*, and *gender*.  Following estimation, we then simulate (using the posterior distribution) support for electoral contestation behaviors under both treatment conditions (pre-election and post-election), which allows us to estimate individual level treatment effects. From here, we just summarize these individual level treatment effects among Trump versus Biden/Harris voters, a *conditional marginal effect*.

Here, we focus on *five* contestation items in both datasets, (1) support for attending a march, (2) support for criticizing the election results, (3) support for burning the American flag, (4) support for taking the matter to court, and (5) support for requesting a recount. Each item is measured on a 5-point scale: (1) Strongly Oppose, (2) Oppose, (3) Neutral, (4) Support, and (5) Strongly Support. 

Three parameterizations for the outcome equations are used.

(1) An *ordered logit* model is estimated for each item, recoding the 5-point scale into three categories: (1) Support (4 and 5), (2) Neutral (3), and (3) Oppose (1 and 2). For this plot, we only present the *Support* category, and the corresponding probability and marginal effects estimates.

(2) A *multinomial logit* model is estimated for each item, again using the recoded data (1) Support (4 and 5), (2) Neutral (3), and (3) Oppose (1 and 2). For this plot, we only present the *Support* category, and the corresponding probability and marginal effects estimates. This relaxes the *parallel lines* assumption in the *ordinal model*, that covariates have the same effect across all categories.

(3) A *linear regression* model is estimated for each item, retaining the 5-point scale. For this plot, we use the `vayr` package to show mean estimates alongisde observed distributions.

Several often ignored problems emerge in causal inference using observational data: (1) selection bias into the treatment, (2) heterogeneity in treatment effects across units, and (3) sampling methods that affect whether a unit is actually observed; what is the mechanism that determines whether a unit is selected into the sample? Selection bias reflects the *fundamental problem of causal inference* in that we are unable to observe a unit in both *treatment* and *control* conditions. While this problem extends to randomized experiments, population averaged effects can be reliably estimated because -- unlike observational data -- knowledge of the treatment assignment assignment allows for the accurate estimation of average treatment effects. For observational data, population averaged effects may be confounded by unobserved variables that influence both treatment assignment and outcome, $y$.

If there exists heterogeneity in treatment effects across units, a single estimated treatment effect may not accurately reflect differences across subpopulations. In our case, interest is in estimating the change from *pre-election* period to *post-election* on support for electoral contestation behaviors, $y$. The average treatment effect is the average difference in $y$ between the *post-election* and *pre-election* periods,

$$
\text{ATE} = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)] - \mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)]
$$ {#eq-ate}

However, if treatment effects vary across subpopulations -- say Trump voters versus Biden voters and/or something else -- the average treatment effect within each subgroup differs. Let $j$ index these groups (e.g., $j = 1$ for Trump, $j = 0$ for Biden)

$$
\text{ATE}_{j} = \mathbb{E}[Y_{ij}(1)] - \mathbb{E}[Y_{ij}(0)] 
$$  {#eq-catej}

If the treatment effect across different subgroups, the *conditional average treatment effect* (CATE), the *average treatment effect* (ATE) is simply the  average weighted by frequency effects for the subgroup.s\footnote{We estimate the Average Treatment Effect among Treated Units (ATT) of prepost assignment for Trump and Biden voters.} When the distance between @eq-ate and @eq-catej increases -- that is, heterogeneity; a considerable difference in treatment effects, a "winner-loser" effect -- @eq-ate does not accurately capture treatment effects.

The third issue, population inference requires knowledge of how the sample units were collected. When units are sampled proportional to that of the broader population, one can adjust for sampling error. Sampling weights are used to readjust for imbalances brought about by random sampling or non-random sampling designs. 

## Relevance to the Western States Data

* (I) seems relevant to our data, particularly 2020 election data, because treatment assignment -- exposure to *pre-election* versus *post-election* period -- may be confounded by unobserved variables that also affect support for electoral contestation behavior. We have imbalanced exposure to *pre* and *post periods*, which may be correlated to unobserved factors. In this case, the assignment mechanism is not entirely random. It's not clear what contributed to being observed in the *pre* or *post* election period. We adjusted for this by *g-estimation* and *inverse probability weighting*. This is a bit more challenging for me to piece together with categorical data, so I estimated models using Bayesiam models to piece this together. 

* (2) is also relevant, because treatment effects vary across subpopulations -- particularly vote choice -- which is a winner and loser effect. Even when controlling for this, there is still heterogeneity within Trump voters, indicating that not all Trump voters respond the same way to the loss.

* (3) is also relevant, because our data are imbalanced (we have an oversample of latinos), and data are only observed in five western states.


## Model Estimation

I started with an ordered logit model in `R`, from the `brms` package. Data are analyzed comparing **pre** v. **post** election, to see if support for electoral contestation behavior (here, attending a march) change  -- for Trump voters versus Biden voters. This is specified to examine whether support for contestation varies depending upon electoral functions; a **winner-loser effect**.

First, let's recode the data, then estimate the model in `brms`. 

In this example, `recode_data` is created by a simple function that scores responses in Support, Neutral, Oppose categories. The `brms` model from is an ordered logit `



```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
recode_data <- westernData %>%
  recode_variable("criticize_election", c("1" = 1, "2" = 1, "3" = 2, "4" = 3, "5" = 3)) |>
  recode_variable("burn_flag", c("1" = 1, "2" = 1, "3" = 2, "4" = 3, "5" = 3)) |>
  recode_variable("court", c("1" = 1, "2" = 1, "3" = 2, "4" = 3, "5" = 3)) |>
  recode_variable("recount", c("1" = 1, "2" = 1, "3" = 2, "4" = 3, "5" = 3)) |>
  recode_variable("attend_march", c("1" = 1, "2" = 1, "3" = 2, "4" = 3, "5" = 3)) 

attend_march = brm(attend_march ~ prepost*vote_trump + female + latino + college + scale(age),
               data = recode_data,
               family = cumulative("logit"),
               cores = 10,
               iter = 2000,
               chains = 3)
burn_flag = brm(burn_flag ~ prepost*vote_trump  + female + latino + college + scale(age),
               data = recode_data,
               family = cumulative("logit"),
               cores = 10,
               iter = 2000,
               chains = 3)
recount = brm(recount ~ prepost*vote_trump  + female + latino + college + scale(age),
               data = recode_data,
               family = cumulative("logit"),
               cores = 10,
               iter = 2000,
               chains = 3)
criticize_election = brm(criticize_election ~ prepost*vote_trump  + female + latino + college + scale(age),
               data = recode_data,
               family = cumulative("logit"),
               cores = 10,
               iter = 2000,
               chains = 3)
court = brm(court ~ prepost*vote_trump  + female + latino + college + scale(age),
               data = recode_data,
               family = cumulative("logit"),
               cores = 10,
               iter = 2000,
               chains = 3)

```



### Construct True Marginal Effects

After running the model, create two versions of the data -- one where all units are in the post-election period, and one where all units are in the pre-election period. Then, just bind these together; they're subsequently used to generate predictions.



```{r}
model_dat = attend_march$data |>
  mutate(id = row_number())

treatment <- model_dat %>%
  mutate(prepost = 1)

control <- model_dat %>%
  mutate(prepost = 0)

full_counterfactual_set <- bind_rows(treatment, control)
```

```{r}
library(tidybayes)
preds_draws <- attend_march %>%
  add_epred_draws(
    newdata = full_counterfactual_set,
    re_formula = NA 
  )
cat("The size of this data is rather large...\n
    as it represents 2000 draws from a posterior for all units in the data...\n
    in two periods, pre and posttest. The dimensions are\n",
    print(dim(preds_draws)))
```




## Summarize Data


```{r}
individual_effects <- preds_draws %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(.draw, id, prepost, .category, .epred, vote_trump) %>% 
  mutate(
    prepost = case_when(
      prepost == 0 ~ "Pre",
      prepost == 1 ~ "Post"
    )
  ) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = prepost,
    values_from = .epred
  ) |>
  mutate(
    individual_effect = Post - Pre
  )


cat("The Average Marginal Effect in the Sample is:")

print(
  individual_effects |>
  summarise(
    mean_ate = mean(individual_effect),
    lower_ci = quantile(individual_effect, 0.025),
    upper_ci = quantile(individual_effect, 0.975)
  )
)
```



## Create Data for Marginal Effect Plot

For this item, Trump voters increase almost 10 percentage points, Biden voters decrease 6 percentage points. 



```{r}
individual_effects |>
  group_by(.category, vote_trump) |>
  summarise(
    mean = mean(individual_effect),
    sd = sd(individual_effect),
    lower = quantile(individual_effect, 0.025),
    upper = quantile(individual_effect, 0.975)
  ) |>
  # Keep only support category
  dplyr::filter(.category == 3) -> marginal_effects_summary

print(marginal_effects_summary)

```



The figure is created by executing this same procedure for all items, binding everything together, the plotted in a dot-whisker type plot,

These data are used to make the left-most portion of the final figure. The predictive effects are just a stop in the process of creating the marginal effects.

The above functions, datasets are trivial to construct. Marginal effects are a little more complicated. Here's how I accomplished this.I construct the marginal effect as follows:

-   Construct a design matrix -- generate predictions when `prepost` $\in 0,1$ and `vote_trump` $\in 0,1$.
-   Pivot the data to wide and construct the differences, the marginal effects.
-   Pivot back to long so that we can summarize the data.
-   Generate mean marginal effects, for each category, when comparing `prepost` = 1 versus `prepost` = 0, for each level of `vote_trump`.

Below is a hardcoded version that only works with 3 category data and the `prepost` variable as the contrast, and `vote_trump` as the moderator. This is followed with a generic function which does the same thing, which I'll use in a moment.



```{r}
library(brms)
library(tidybayes)

D_matrix = expand_grid(
  prepost = c(0, 1),
  vote_trump = c(0, 1)
)

## Construct Marginal Effects

    names_from = prepost,
    values_from = starts_with("prob_"),
    names_sep = "_"
  ) |>

    marginal_effect_1 = prob_1_1 - prob_1_0,
    marginal_effect_2 = prob_2_1 - prob_2_0,
    marginal_effect_3 = prob_3_1 - prob_3_0
  ) |>
  dplyr::select(vote_trump, .draw, starts_with("marginal_effect")) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(vote_trump) %>%
  summarise(
    mean1 = mean(marginal_effect_1),
    sd1 = sd(marginal_effect_1),
    lower1 = quantile(marginal_effect_1, 0.025),
    upper1 = quantile(marginal_effect_1, 0.975),
    mean2 = mean(marginal_effect_2),
    sd2 = sd(marginal_effect_2),
    lower2 = quantile(marginal_effect_2, 0.025),
    upper2 = quantile(marginal_effect_2, 0.975),
    mean3 = mean(marginal_effect_3),
    sd3 = sd(marginal_effect_3),
    lower3 = quantile(marginal_effect_3, 0.025),
    upper3 = quantile(marginal_effect_3, 0.975),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
pivot_longer(
  cols = -vote_trump,
  names_to = c(".value", "category"),
  names_pattern = "(.+)(\\d)$"
) -> marginal_effect

```



## Generalized Function

The above function is hardcoded to work with `prepost` as the contrast variable, and `vote_trump` as the moderator, with three categories. Let's make it more generalizable



```{r}
marginal_effects_summary <- calculate_marginal_effects(
     model = attend_march,
     contrast_var = prepost,
     contrast_vals = c(0, 1),
     moderators = tibble(vote_trump = c(0, 1))
 )



head(marginal_effects_summary)
```



The three dataframes, `observed_counts`, `predictive_effects_summary`, and `marginal_effects_summary` are now ready for plotting. \## This is how it should look.

The margins for the plot are generated with `observed_counts`, whereas the dot-lines are generated with `predictive_effects_summary`. This constitutes the left panel of the plot. The right panel is generated from `marginal_effects_summary`.



```{r}
marginal_effects_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .category, y = mean, color = factor(vote_trump))) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50", size = 0.8) +
  geom_point(size = 2, position = position_dodge(width = 0.3)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper),
                width = 0.15, size = 1,
                position = position_dodge(width = 0.3), alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("1" = "Oppose",
                              "2" = "Neutral",
                              "3" = "Support")) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Vote Choice",
                     values = c("0" = "black", "1" = "grey"),
                     labels = c("0" = "Biden", "1" = "Trump")) +
  labs(
    x = "Response Category",
    y = "Marginal Effect (Post - Pre)",
    title = "Marginal Effects",
    subtitle = "Error bars are 95% confidence intervals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
    theme(
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", margin = margin(b = 5)),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, color = "gray40", margin = margin(b = 15)),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "gray95", size = 0.3),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold", color = "gray20"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "gray95", color = "white"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10, color = "gray30"),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 11, color = "gray20", face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
        plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20)
    ) +
  coord_flip() -> marginal_effects
```

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
library(patchwork)
predictive_effects + marginal_effects +
  plot_layout(widths = c(0.3, 0.5),
              heights = c(1, 0.5)) +
plot_annotation(
  title = "Attending a March or Rally",
  subtitle = "Predicted probabilities and marginal effects by vote choice",
  caption = "Source: Western States Survey 2020. N = 2,000 respondents.",
  theme = theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, color = "gray40", hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 5)),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, color = "gray60", hjust = 1)
  )
)

```



From the *pre* to *post* period, Trump voters increased their support for attending a march or rally by about 10 points ($\Delta_y = 0.971, SD = 0.024, 95% \text{Credible Interval} = 0.0520, 0.147)$). Biden voters show the opposite pattern, decreasing their support by about 5 points ($\Delta_y = -0.0612, SD = 0.0246, 95% \text{Credible Interval} = -0.109, -0.002$).

## Counterfactual Estimation

In the previous iteration of our paper, we used structural *G*-estimation to compute counterfactuals. The logic is to (1) estimate the treatment model -- here exposure to *pre* or *post* election -- as a function of covariates, (2) use the treatment model to generate predicted probabilities of treatment assignment, (3) create a counterfactual dataset where the treatment is inverted for all respondents, and (4) generate predicted values from the outcome model for both the observed and counterfactual datasets. The difference between the two is the average treatment effect. Here's a similar approach using Bayesian estimation.



```{r}
library(dplyr)

## Fit Model
attend_march = brm(attend_march ~ prepost*vote_trump + female + age +
                     libcon + authoritarianism + faminc + college  ,
               data = recode_data,
               family = cumulative("logit"),
               cores = 10,
               iter = 2000,
               chains = 1)

# Generate two copies of data, one observed, one counterfactual

# Observed Condition:
observed_data <- recode_data %>%
  mutate(pre_condition = "actual_treatment")



# Counterfactual Condition: If you voted
counterfactual_data <- recode_data %>%
  mutate(
    pre_condition = "hypothetical_treatment",
    prepost = 1 - prepost # Flips 0 to 1, and 1 to 0 for everyone
  )

# Combine them into a single data frame for prediction
full_counterfactual_set <- bind_rows(observed_data, counterfactual_data)
```



## Two Scenarios

I've created two copies of the same data -- one where `prepost` is observed, and one where `prepost` is flipped for everyone, the counterfactual. Now we can generate predicted values for both scenarios at the individual level.



```{r}

individual_preds <- fitted(
  attend_march,
  newdata = full_counterfactual_set,
  summary = FALSE
)
```

```{r}

# Example of how you might aggregate the individual effects
# (requires advanced data wrangling beyond base matrix manipulation)

library(tidybayes)

# Use posterior_epred_draws to get the expected outcome for each draw/person/condition
preds_draws <- attend_march %>%
  add_epred_draws(
    newdata = full_counterfactual_set,
    re_formula = NA # Optional: Ignores group-level effects if you have them
  )

# Separate the observed and counterfactual predictions using the 'condition' column
individual_effects <- preds_draws %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(.draw, id_column, condition, .epred) %>% # You'll need an 'id_column' in your original data
  spread(condition, .epred) %>%
  mutate(individual_effect = actual_vote - hypothetical_vote)

# Summarize the average effect across all individuals
average_counterfactual_effect <- individual_effects %>%
  summarise(
    mean_ate = mean(individual_effect),
    lower_ci = quantile(individual_effect, 0.025),
    upper_ci = quantile(individual_effect, 0.975)
  )

print(average_counterfactual_effect)
```

```{r}
# Expected value plot with 1-5 scale and labeled points
 ggplot(marginal_effects_summary, aes(x = prepost_label, y = mean,
                               color = vote_trump_label, group = vote_trump_label)) +
  # Add midpoint reference line at 3
  geom_hline(yintercept = 3, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50", linewidth = 0.5) +
  # geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci, fill = vote_trump_label),
  #             alpha = 0.2, color = NA) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_ci, ymax = upper_ci),
                width = 0.005, linewidth = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "Expected Support Level",
    color = "Vote Choice",
    fill = "Vote Choice",
    title = "Attend a March or Rally",
    subtitle = "Expected value = sum(category x probability) with 95% confidence intervals"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(2, 4),
    breaks = 2:4,
    labels = c("2" = "Oppose",
               "3" = "Neutral",
               "4" = "Support")
```



The Pre/Post comparisons can be presented like this,



```{r}

plotDots(plot_burn$plotting_data |>
          filter(vote_trump == 0),
          y_var = "mean_prob",
          color_var = "prepost",
          x_var = "category",
          color_levels = c(0, 1),
          color_labels = c("Pre", "Post"),
          color_values = c("grey", "black"),
          title = "Flag Burning",
          category_levels = c("1", "2", "3"),
          category_labels = c("Disagree", "Neither","Agree"))

## Marginal effects.

Say are interest is in whether these changes are statistically significant at the conventional 0.05 level. We can use the `predict_logit_probs()` function to generate predicted probabilities from a binary logit model, and then summarize those predictions.

This gives us the marginal effect of supporting attending a march, for Trump voters versus Biden voters, from pre- to post-election. The marginal effect is just the change from pre to post for each group.

              heights = c(1, 0.5))
```



### Counterfactuals 

The counterfactual for each respondent is not observable -- what *would* happen to those assigned to the post-election if they were instead assigned to the pre-election and vice-versa. So, what I do is first, estimate the model. Then, create two versions of the data; each dataset can be thought of as a population. In one version, the data is simply the observed data, in the second version, the pre-post variable is flipped for everyone. So, in the second dataset, everyone who was in the pre-election is put in the pre-election and those in the post-election are recoded as post-election. Then, I pass these datasets to the models -- which too are distributions, the posterior distributions of the parameters -- to generate predictions. From here, the different posterior predictive values constitute *what-if* scenarios -- e.g. everyone in the dataset is  and it's then fairly simple to calculate different treatment effects. Together these are the steps involved in the *g-computation* framework which we've been using. It involves fitting a model to the observed data -- the ordered or multinomial logit or linear regression -- and then simulating potential outcomes where every individual is in every treatment condition.

```



By setting it up in this way -- creating a copy of the dataset where pre and post are flipped --  the treatment effect for every respondent can be calculated (over many simulated draws from the posterior distribution). From here, I can then calculated different types of treatment effects -- average treatment effects and conditional average treatment effects.

## Imbalance

Inclusion into the survey is partially known because we have an oversample of Latino voters...So I thought I'd include additional covariates, which we can similarly average across...
